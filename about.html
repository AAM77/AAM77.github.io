<p>I generally prefer to be referred to as Adeelâ€”as in "let's make a deal." If I were to sum up who I am, it would go something like this: I am a seeker of knowledge and a highly adaptive individual who has been a New Yorker most of my life. I have many passions, but most consistently of all, I love learning and teaching. I learn to understand and I understand to teach, as I enjoy helping others and sharing my knowledge with them, if they request it. At the end of the day, however, I am simply a jack of all trades attempting to become a master of sorts in the realm of computer science.</p>
