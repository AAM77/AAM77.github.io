Alright, it has taken some time, but I am finally ready to begin blogging on a weekly to bi-weekly basis.

Considering this is the second blog post I have written in the entire course of my life, it should not be surprising that I experienced difficulty in deciding where to begin. Flatiron provides useful suggestions on the Blog Dashboard, of course, but I did not want to write seven standalone posts on different topics that had web development as the only common factor. If I am to blog, I intend on going all in and doing so long-term. Therefore, I want to write about connected topics that are useful and informative, but I need the blog to have some structure. The overarching theme needs to be something that is meaningful to me so that blogging does not become an unwelcome chore.
 
*I do not like doing things long-term simply for the sake of doing them. There has to be at least some purpose behind it.*

So, with this in mind, I took a break from coding and headed off to the internet in search of inspiration. Doing so was certainly helpful and it will no doubt continue to serve as an invaluable resource, but the source of my inspiration in this case was much closer to home than I first thought. It began with the <a style="color:rgb(0, 153, 153);" href="http://adeelstechbeat.net/about/" target="blank">about me</a> section of my blog: "I learn to understand and I understand to teach." Those who know me very well know that I love to learn and that I like helping those around me. I enjoy exchanging knowledge with others, learning from them while offering to teach them skills I know. I also have some reasonable degree of skill in writing and am somewhat creative—though you wouldn't be able to tell from my blog's not so clever web address [/chuckle chuckle/]—so doing something along these lines through blogging could work.

After receiving input from friends and family, I mulled over the insight and suggestions they had provided me with. It was in this meditative state that an idea began to take shape. What if I wrote instructional blogs that taught people about topics related to computers? One of my friends had, after all, suggested long ago I make videos online teaching topics in mathematics and science because of my experience in tutoring those subjects.

It could work.
*Couldn't it?*

I discussed the idea with those close to me and they appeared to support me. Well, it piqued their interest, at least, but did not know where I should start. We were in the same boat, then, and I welcomed the company, but it did us no good if we had no direction and no paddles to row with. So, there was nothing to it but to set about making some paddles. Don't ask me where I got the wood from: I needed paddles and the boat's sides were a little too high for my liking.

*Sometimes you need to be willing to breakdown and reshape the boat you're in if you intend on getting anywhere.*

*This works well with boxes, too!*

So, I had structure for my blog and a general idea related to programming and web development. What I lacked were the specifics. As I thought about this, I realized that part of the answer was staring me in the face: **literally**. My browser was open to a lesson covering CSS selectors on Flatiron's learn.co and I had the drop down navigation menu for the curriculum open. "Why not go about discussing that?" I thought. It made sense, after all: It would help me learn and I would get practice coding, no?

But, which topic should I tackle first? There were enough topics on there to make one's head spin. The curriculum starts with Ruby, but HTML seemed to be the more sensible starting point for my blog. Then, again, there was a lot for me to talk about in comparing my existing knowledge of programming to what I had learned so far in Ruby. I became frustrated thinking about this, so I decided to shift gears and work on the lesson at hand before tackling the blog.

I opened up the Terminal on my Mac and got ready to setup a new local repository using the command line.

*That was when it hit me.*
Why not start with something not readily discussed, but often used and clearly important: **Bash**.

Without going into detail and at the risk of oversimplification, this has to do with the command-line interface (CLI). This is the program some movie goers associate with hackers (those green letters trickling down a black screen in the Matrix, even). For Windows users, this is the command prompt (cmd.exe) while Mac and Linux users may know it as the Terminal. In either case, it is a simple looking program that you type commands into to tell your computer what to do.

In my limited experience as a beginner coder, it seems to be an issue many people new to coding run into. At some point, they end up having to interact with this mysterious terminal that they are instructed to type keywords into so that seemingly magical things can happen. It is something that most of us will likely use frequently in our careers as developers. In the beginning, though, at least some of us do not have a clear sense of what it is, how to use it, or why it is necessary. I encountered this issue multiple times since I began coding. Instructors for my Analysis and Design course, for example, complained about incoming students not knowing even the basics of Bash, let alone C++. I have also come across questions on Flatiron, Slack, and various forums pertaining to the Terminal and how to use it. So, it made sense to start there.

Once I had the topic nailed down, I set about planning out a blog post discussing the basics of Bash. During the planning phase, however, I realized that fitting all the information into one blog post would be too much. It might be better and more manageable if I split it into two or more since I intend most of my blog posts to be on the shorter end in the hopes they are easier to digest. But, I suppose I will get a better idea on how to move forward once I begin posting. These are my first few attempts at blogging and the finer details of how I structure the blog and topics may yet change. At the risk of sounding cliché: as with most skills, practice makes perfect.

Rarely is anyone perfect when they begin. When we watch videos or read blogs, we see the end product, not all the effort and time that went into its making—sometimes fun, sometimes frustrating. If we visit earlier posts from the same author, we notice how unrefined their technique was when they first started. My posts may not be great or thorough at first, but I hope my skills as a blogger and teacher improve as I gain more experience and knowledge of web development and blogging.

This is a new adventure and I embrace its beginnings with utter excitement and optimism. I do not expect many, if anyone to read my blog, but if my posts help even one person, I will consider it a success.

Thanks for reading!
